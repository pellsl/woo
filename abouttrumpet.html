		<h2>A History of the Elusive Trumpetfish</h2>
		
	<p>Trumpetfish are named for the famed trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. Dizzy was the grandson of the King of Tuvalu. 
	He spent his youth in Tuvalu before becoming the musician he is known as today. It was well known that
	he kept several of these fish as pets. At the time they were known as Nunu fish, but it has become more famously 
	known as the Trumpetfish since he came to prominence on the musical stage.</p>
		
		<h2>Trumpetfish Habitat</h2>
		
		<p>Trumpetfish are distributed globally in tropical waters. They are not open ocean fish, rather living on coral
		reefs. They can be found in both near shore waters and in waters up to 30 meters deep, inhabiting 
		bioherms. They are masters of camouflage, often hanging in the water column waiting for prey to come 
		along or swimming amongst grazers to get close to unsuspecting food before pouncing. They will, at times, 
		swim vertically while trying to blend in among vertical coral, such as sea 
		pens and pipe sponges. </p>
		
		
		<h2>How to Identify a Trumpetfish</h2>

		<p>Trumpetfish are long slender fish, oval in cross-section, growing up to 3 feet long. Their mouth is 
		featured at the end of a long snout. They have one small dorsal fin set back on the body. The
		tail fin is broad and fanning. They can come in a large range of colors such as yellow, 
		orange, silver, and grey-brown. Additionally, the 
		Trumpetfish is capable of changing its coloring to assist in its ability to camouflage.</p>
		
		<p>Trumpetfish are more often solitary fish, though can be found occasionally in pairs. It would be highly
		unusual to find them in schools.</p>
		
			
		<h2>Common Mistakes in Identification</h2>
<img class="left" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ymz7995gpwsqy48/cornetvstrumpet.dms?dl=0" alt="Trumpetfish versus a cornet fish">
		<p>Trumpetfish and Cornetfish are members of the family that includes
		seahorses. The  tail on the Cornetfish is not fanned, but is more lunate shaped with a long thin tail filament
		trailing behind it. The easiest way to remember how to distinguish the two while out swimming is to
		imagine the instruments they are named for -- a cornet horn is long, slender and constricted, while the trumpet 
		has a more flared bell.</p>

		<p> Cornetfish are not the only fish that Trumpetfish can be confused with. 
		They can also be mistaken for juvenile barracudas as they both have long slender bodies. But 
		they are so strikingly different apart from this that it would be hard to make this mistake. For one, 
		barracudas have a large toothed mouth with a significant underbite, and two dorsal fins.
		Needlefish are more likely to be confused with trumpetfish, but their long, beaklike mouths set them apart.
		Additionally, Needlefish and Cornet fish are distinctive from the Trumpetfish in that they both travel in large schools
		of fish. </p>
		
		<p>While there are other musical fish in the sea such as the Banjo Catfish, Bass, and Fiddler Rays, 
		the photos below make their differences obvious... though I'm sure together, they would make a fabulous band.</p>

	<h2>I.T.F.A.R.T.S. Recommended Instruments</h2>
	<img class="left" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com" alt="The Spongebob Trumpetfish Caller" title="The Spongebob Trumpetfish Caller">
	<p>I.T.F.A.R.T.S. highly recommends the Sponge Bob Trumpetfish Caller to enhance your viewing pleasure.
	It will enable better location and identification of said Trumpetfish. While other apparati
	may allow you to locate some Trumpetfish, no tool is as similar to the native Trumpetfish Call as the Sponge Bob 
	Trumpetfish Caller. Every W.O.O. researcher uses this fish caller. Are you as good as W.O.O.? </p>
