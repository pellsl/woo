		<h2>Are You an Explorer?</h2>
		
		<p>Imagine yourself adrift on an ocean far from home. Maybe you see a deserted island, and you paddle 
		frantically for it. Upon reaching those restive shores, that island sanctuary, you take a moment to consider 
		your surroundings. You see a stream, so you have a water source. Palm trees ring the beach, with coconuts 
		aplenty. The lush inner jungle is heavy with fruit. "Is this Eden?" you ask yourself. And then you remember 
		the fish that you saw while paddling yourself toward the island. You recall the harmonious 
		sounds and the vibrant colors of the Trumpetfish heard from just below the diamond-studded waves.</p>
		
		<p>The Trumpetfish is a most noble creature. One that is strangled by humanity. Its haunting beauty is
		the Sirens' Song of the sea. The International Trumpetfish Advocacy, Recovery and Tracking Society is
		committed to assuring the survival and proliferation of this beautiful animal, so that future generations
		might benefit and learn from its profound impact on the oceanic community.</p>
		
		<p>We hope that you might hear the plight of this enigmatic creature and lend
		your hand in assisting I.T.F.A.R.T.S. in locating and identifying Trumpetfish globally. </p>
