		<p id="photo-tag">Henry Bryant Bigelow was a pioneering researcher for W.O.O. in the late 1890's. Here he

		<p>World Ocean Observers is the world's premier oceanic research group. Having been established in 1889,
		W.O.O. was at the forefront of deep water research. They were the first organization to locate the 
		up-to-then mythical whale shark in 1901, and have categorized and tagged at least 150 varieties of jelly 
		fish.</p>

		<p>Their research has been used by a wide variety of organizations to enhance the world's understanding of 
		sea creatures, their environs, and the impact of humanity on them. Today, more than ever, W.O.O. is needed 
		as we tackle climate change globally. They have had a profound impact on the Pisaster disaster that has been
		occurring for the last several years. They have been substantial contributors to research by The Atlantic 
		National Geothermal Society, Hydrological Oceanographic Organization, and Young Engineers of Aquatic Health. 
		They have also worked tirelessly for lesser known marine biota such as, the Sea Carrot, 
		the North Pacific Gyre Isopod, and the Eastern Bulgogi Whale.</p>
