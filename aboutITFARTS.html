		<h2>About the International Trumpetfish Advocacy, Recovery, and Tracking Society (I.T.F.A.R.T.S.)</h2>
		<p>In the early 1960's W.O.O. took a special interest in managing and maintaining Trumpetfish populations 
		globally, at the behest of W.O.O. President Herb Albert, who had dedicated his career to the Trumpets. </p>
		
		<p>I.T.F.A.R.T.S. was established in 1962 as a specialized branch of the World Ocean Observers. 
		It was formed in response to the Panamanian Open Ocean Policy, which granted greater access to large 
		marine vessels travelling through the mighty, southern Canal. 
		This policy led to similar policies around the world. 
		There was the Singapore/Hanoi International Trade bill, the Bengali Underwater Tourism Tunnel, 
		the Dubai Unionized Nautical Group policy, and the Cuba and China Alliance. In the United States, there was
		the Florida Trade and Environment Rule (FLO-TER) and the Texas Urbanization Redevelopment 
		Directive. These policies diminished and destroyed precious underwater habitats for a 
		variety of marine life, and in particular, the already threatened Trumpetfish. </p>
		<p>I.T.F.A.R.T.S. has been a warrior for Trumpetfish and has helped craft legislation to obstruct 
		these harmful movements worldwide.  These international rules bind up the polluting organizations and 
		help flush out offending policies.</p>
